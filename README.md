# educative.io_scraper
This a python selenium script used to scrap Educative.io courses.

Run the script without headless mode if your account isn't signed in.
After Signup , stop the script and run the script in headless mode.
Provide a starting number for file naming (useful for resume if code breaks or network problems during scraping) and provide the first link of the topic from the course or the topic link which wasn't downloaded during scraping.

Status: Script is working correctly, need some cleaning and optimisations.
