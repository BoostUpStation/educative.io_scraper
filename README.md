         text file as shown below.

      2. Run both the executables chromedriver and educative_scraper by downloading them from latest releases.
      Note: If the executable release version is older than the current github repo version then run the project 
            manually explained below.

      3. Select a config if you don't want to use the default config "0" by pressing 2.
         (Make sure to generate the config if it is selected for the first time)

      4. Generate the config (if not created) and provide the urls text file path, save location and headless 
         mode by pressing 1.

      5. Login your educative account by pressing 3.
      6. Start Scraping by pressing 4.
      7. To return to Main Menu/ Exit Scraper press Ctrl+C / CMD+C.

##### Note 1: If the scraper fails or the User Exits in between for any specific reason, a log.txt file will be created in the save path, containing the index and last known url while scraping, copy the {index url} and replace it in the urls text file to resume scraping the course where it was stopped previously by restarting the scraper.

      (Make sure to delete the urls that are already scraped while replacing in the urls text file)

##### Note 2: If for any reason your system shuts down for power failure or the scraper crashes then you have to manually search the url and index and provide the {index url} in urls text file since the scraper cannot create log.txt for sudden power cut/ crash.

## To Run the project manually:

### Step 1: Install the virtualenv package for python3 and create a virtual environment named "env".

      pip3 install virtualenv
      virtualenv env

### Step 2: Activate the environment.

#### > (For Windows)

      env\Scripts\activate


#### > (For MacOS/Linux)

      source env/bin/activate


### Step 3: Install the required modules:

      pip3 install -r requirements.txt


### Step 4: Download, extract and paste the respective Chrome-bin for your OS from the latest releases section inside the Chrome-bin folder.

### Step 5: Open up two terminals and run the following commands.

      python3 chromedriver.py
      python3 educative_scraper.py


### Step 6: Refer, "How to use the Scraper?" explained above except point 2.

## To Build the chromdriver and educative-scraper executables using pyinstaller:

#### Activate the Virtual Environment and Install the required modules for the project (Refer Step 1, 2, 3 above).

#### Install the pyinstaller package and run the following commands.

      pip3 install pyinstaller


#### > (For Windows)

      pyinstaller --clean --add-data Chrome-bin;Chrome-bin --onefile -i"icon.ico" educative_scraper.py
      pyinstaller --clean --add-data "Chrome-driver;Chrome-driver" --onefile -i"icon.ico" chromedriver.py


#### > (For MacOS/Linux)

      pyinstaller --clean --add-data Chrome-bin:Chrome-bin --onefile -i"icon.ico" educative_scraper.py
      pyinstaller --clean --add-data "Chrome-driver:Chrome-driver" --onefile -i"icon.ico" chromedriver.py

Pyinstaller command for Linux OS may or may not work due to a pyinstaller bug, currently checking for a fix.\
A Whitepaper will be released containing the explanation of each functions and the cases handled by the scraper.
